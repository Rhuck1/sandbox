    "1. An integer *num_slots* representing the total number of meeting slots to return  \n",
    "2. A list of lists of strings representing each employee's list of meetings (parameter employee_schedules). Meetings are specified as strings in th format \"XX:XX-YY:YY\" with XX:XX as the beginning time of the meeting and YY:YY as the end time of the meeting, all in zero-padded 24-hour time. The very end of the day can be expressed as 24:00 for simplicity\n",

    "[\"00:00-05:00\", \"08:00-22:00\"],\n",

    "Output:  \n",
    "A list of strings representing the optima meeting times in earlies-to-latest order. An unsorted output will count as incorrect. Optimal is defined as follows:\n",
    "1. Meetings with the highest number of employees should be prioritized.\n",
    "2. For meetings with the same number of employees that can attend, the meeting with the earlier start time should be prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  \n",
    "If the number of possible valid meeting slots that can be constructed is less than the requested amount, *num_slots*, the function should return and empty list of meeting slots([])\n",

    "* Two meetings: 12:30-13:00 and 13:00-14:00 do not overlap, where the first is a meeting that ends at 1:00pm and the second is a meeting that starts at 1:00pm\n",
    "* Any employee who is not in a meeting at any given time is considered \"free\" and can be scheduled for a meeeting. Inversely, an employee who is scheduled for a meeting at a given time cannot attend any other mettings at that time. This is also true for meeting slots.\n",
    "* Meetings are scheduled at 15 min intervals (i.e. 07:15 is a valid start time or end time for a meeting, 18:47 is not). As a consequence, an meetings scheduled must be at least 15 min in length.  \n",
    "* A meeting cannot be scheduled for a time if fewer than 2 employees are available at that time.  \n",
    "* Importantly, meeting slots must be selected for the maximum amount of time possible wihtout decreasing the number of employees that can attend while still generating valid, optimal meeting slots. In other words, if some set of employees are all available from 10:00-10:30, the valid meeting slot would be 10:00-10:30, 2 meeting slots from 10:00-10:15 and 10:15-10:30 would not be valid and distinct.\n",
    "* If 3 other coworkers (for a total of 6 participants) are available during a chunk of the potential meeting slot (i.e. 10:15-10:30), to still output the most optimal shiwl still valid slots, two valid slots (due to valid slots not overlapping) can be formed. One with 6 participants 10:15-10:30 (more optimal) and one with 3 participants from 10:00-10:15 (less optimal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Output:\n",
    "[\"05:30-08:00\", \"12:30-22:00\", \"22:00-24:00\"]  \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of *num_slots* is 3 and the 3 valid optimal meeting slots were returned. The 3rd meeting slot has 3 available participants, and the first two each only had two available participants. The output is sorted in earliest-to-latest order. The full available, distinct meeting slots are returned not truncated to allow for more meetings (such as incorrectly splitting up \"22:00-24:00\" into shorted contiguous meeting slots).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint:  \n",
